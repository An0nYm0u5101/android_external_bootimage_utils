= SUMMARY =

The LZOP file format consists of a magic number, followed
by the file header, followed by one or more compressed
blocks:
  MAGIC + FILE HEADER + BLOCK1 + BLOCK2 + ... + BLOCKN

Each block consists of a block header, with several required
and optional items, followed by compressed data.

The last block in a file consists of only an uncompressed
block size of zero, thus all LZOP files should end with
four NULL bytes.
